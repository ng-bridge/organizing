This workshop's going to be amazing!! Here's what we need to do!

A few months out:
- [ ] Find a venue and sponsor for the workshop. Sponsoring the workshop costs between $400 and $900, depending on the size of the workshop.
- [ ] Find two co-organizers. It's a lot of work, but always a lot of fun. No experience is necessary; checkout the [workshop cookbook](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/Cookbook) if it's new to you. (Also, we match up first time organizers with mentors.)

Leave a comment below if you're able to host, sponsor or organize! :smile_cat: 

Once we have a a venue, sponsors, and organizers, we can:
- [ ] Work together to set an RSVP limit that works for everyone
- [ ] Post the workshop to [Bridge Troll](http://www.bridgetroll.org/)
- [ ] Post the workshop to appropriate Meetup group(s) for publicity 

One to two weeks out, we can:
- [ ] Plan a teacher training
- [ ] Order breakfast
- [ ] Order lunch
- [ ] Find a good place for the afterparty

After the workshop, we can:
- [ ] Party! :tada:   
- [ ] Retro
